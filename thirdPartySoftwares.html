                        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
                        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
                        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
                        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

                        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
                        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
                        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
                        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
                        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
                        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
                        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                        as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
                        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
                        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
                        meet the following conditions:

                        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                            stating that You changed the files; and

                        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                            the Derivative Works; and

                        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                            as modifying the License.

                        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
                        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
                        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                        the conditions stated in this License.

                    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
                        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
                        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
                        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
                        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
                        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
                        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
                        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
                        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

                        To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
                        boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
                        replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
                        the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
                        comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
                        file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
                        same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
                        identification within third-party archives.
